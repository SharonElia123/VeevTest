# How to search in google selenium and test the results
# Also, a short script for a test at Selenium Grid
# There is reports+ Logs

1. Test Main--> you can find which test we are running, also, you can see which browser we are running, devide to IE and Chrome
2. Action--> Which action we need to do for our Test.
3. LOG--> Define our logs.
4. POM--> Which elements we are need to locate.
5. Utility--> Define the Base driver, which browser to run, Screen shut.
Also, we have the TestNg Runner
